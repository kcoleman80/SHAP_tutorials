# SHAP_tutorials
A game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model
SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model.
Thank you to Scott Lundberg for the extensive explanation and Github repository!

SHAP — which stands for SHapley Additive exPlanations — is probably the state of the art in Machine Learning explainability. This algorithm was first published in 2017 by Lundberg and Lee and it is a brilliant way to reverse-engineer the output of any predictive algorithm.
